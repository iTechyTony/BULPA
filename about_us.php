					<h2>The Company</h2>
					<p>Bulpa is online used laptops, mobile phones and components seller with 10 registered customers and 2 employees. Founded in 2013, the company started off as the brainchild of a group of IT developers and PC retail experts, who wanted computer components to be more readily available and at lower prices. 
At Bulpa, our business philosophy is simple: give customers and businesses what they want, when they want it. We never stop improving our world class operation by putting our customers - and their needs - firs</p>
					
					<h2>Products</h2>

Bulpa customers know they're getting the best prices and exclusive offers on a huge range of used laptops, phones and components . Bulpa caters for everyone with its affordable products.Our Business store is also growing. And to help our customers choose the right products, we make it easy to find stock and pricing.</p>
